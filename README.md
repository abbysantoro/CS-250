How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

To be able to interpret user needs you first need to research and disover what these needs are and details about them. This could be done in many ways such as questionaires and/or focus groups. After defining user needs it is best to put these needs into a scenario or a story. Defining requirements of the program directly from the results of these questionaires and/or focus groups could get extremely confusing. Some needs are repeated by the user or they have needs beyond the scope of the program. Creating user stories before identifying exact requirements gives programers a much better "map" of what is needed from the user and what is required to complete that task. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

The best thing to do when approaching a new program to be developed is to be absolutly sure that the requirements and expectations are completely clear between the client and the development team. Making sure client expectations are managed and the development team has all of the clarifications they need before the development process starts is sure to eliminate some problems before programming even begins. Some agile processes I think will be extremely beneficial to incorporate into my future development work would be daily scrums and planning poker time estimation practices. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

In order to be a good team member in software development I think there are at least three things that one should excel at. The first is transparency which in my opinion fall right in line with communication. A good software developer is transparent about their abilities and progress on tasks and be able to communicate this effectively and often. Another quality of a good team member in software development is flexibility. Developers should be flexible about their role and skills within the development team and aware that what is good for an individual developer may not be what is good or needed within the team or development project. The final aspect that makes a good team member when it comes to software development is the constant willingness to learn something new. This industry is constantly changing and improving itself so it only makes sense that the programmers in the industry do the same.
